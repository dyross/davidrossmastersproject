  abstract={
  Automating tools for geo-locating and geo-orienting static cameras is
  a key step in creating a useful global imaging network from cameras
  attached to the Internet.  We present algorithms for partial camera
  calibration that rely on access to accurately time-stamped images
  captured over time from cameras that do not move.  To support these
  algorithms we also offer a method of camera viewpoint change
  detection, or ``tamper detection'', which determines if a camera has
  moved in the challenging case when images are only captured every half
  hour.  These algorithms are tested on a subset of the AMOS (Archive of
  Many Outdoor Scenes) database, and we present preliminary results that
  highlight the promise of these approaches.
