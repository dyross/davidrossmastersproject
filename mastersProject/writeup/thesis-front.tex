\begin{thesisabstract}
Webcams are cheap and abundant sensors that are easily deployed, maintained, and archived.  The AMOS Dataset, which has captured over 1,000 webcams for three years, provides a multitude of diverse scenes, many of which contain interesting variation.  The great size of this data makes keeping track of each scene's content impractical.  This project explores techniques for automatically visualizing and characterizing these variations over static scenes.  The mathematical tool Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is useful for learning common image variations, and its error can be leveraged to show less common and more interesting variation.  With this technique, it is more reasonable to maintain and use such large sets of scenes.

\begin{thesisacknowledgments}

First, I want to thank my advisor, Professor Robert Pless, for four years of teaching, guidance, and support.  Without his direction, this project would not have been completed and my four years here would not have been so rewarding.

I want to thank the graduate students in the Media and Machines Lab, especially Nathan Jacobs and Michael Dixon, for helping me along the way.  Very rarely did a question go unanswered with them around.  Also, thanks to Professors Tao Ju and Bill Smart for agreeing to be on my presentation committee.  I hope you learned something from me for once.

Finally, my utmost gratitude to Washington University, specifically the Computer Science Department.  My four years here have prepared me so well for what's ahead.
