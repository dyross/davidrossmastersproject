The original goal of this project was to find clean mathematical tools to catalog the objects found in a particular webcam scene.  Cameras vary in sufficiently difficult ways to make this hard, so we investigated general tools for visualizing these variations.

\section{Future Work}

[Interface with AMOS website]
The visualization tools presented in this project 

[Item Extraction]

Although the original goal of the project was not met, these visualization tools give information that would be helpful for the original problem.  

[Customizable Visualizations]

Another area that this work could be expanded in is user interaction.  A tool with which a user could specify what type of information he or she is interested in would be very powerful.
