\begin{thesisacknowledgments}

First, I want to thank my advisor, Professor Robert Pless for four years of teaching, guidance, and support.  Without his direction, this project would not have been completed, and my four years here would not have been as successful.

I want to thank the graduate students in the Media and Machines Lab, especially Nathan Jacobs and Michael Dixon, for helping me along the way.  Very rarely did I have a question that went unanswered for long.  Also, thanks to Tao Ju and Bill Smart for agreeing to be on my project committee.  I hope you enjoyed it.
